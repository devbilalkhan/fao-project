# Wheat Price Forecasting and Its Relation to Food Inflation in Belgium and Germany

This initiative is focused on dissecting and projecting the trends of wheat prices within the economies of Belgium and Germany, while also delving into the implications of food inflation on these price movements. Leveraging a suite of time series forecasting models, we aim precise predictions of forthcoming wheat price directions. The foundational data for our analysis is sourced from the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data).

## Overview of the Project

Central to the agricultural sectors of Belgium and Germany, wheat stands as a vital staple that not only sustains local markets but also exerts influence on the global stage. The dynamic correlation between the prices farmers receive for wheat and the overarching trends of food inflation commands the attention of economists and policy developers alike. Through examination of historical wheat pricing records and the application of advanced time series analysis methodologies, this project aspires to anticipate and chart potential price trajectories. The foresight provided by our predictive models intends to deepen the understanding of prevailing economic dynamics and aid in devising informed measures to temper the detrimental effects of food inflation.
